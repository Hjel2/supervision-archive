View a column matrix as an $n \times 1$ matrix.

When you use index notation, you should include the 1. IE $x_i = x_{i,1}$.

Ambiguity can arise and you have to be careful.

You can rearrange elements in index notation since all you have are integer multiplication.

\begin{gather*}
x_{j} b_{ij} = b_{ij}x_j \longrightarrow \mathbf{Bx}
x_{j} b_{ij} = x^T_{1j}B^T_{ji} \longrightarrow \mathbf{Bx}^T
\end{gather*}
Note that this does not mean $\mathbf{Bx} = \mathbf{Bx}^T$. It means that the $i$th element of the column vector
$\mathbf{Bx}$ is equal to the $i$th element in the row vector $\mathbf{Bx}^T$.

If every element below or above the leading diagonal is zero, then the determinant is the product of the leading
diagonal.

Never try to expand the determinant if it's a large matrix. You should only rearrange the columns or rows.

10. The matrix you're given is antisymmetric. It works for any antisymmetric matrix $\mathbf{M}$ such that there is a
 single non-zero minor diagonal.
 
The matrix is an antisymmetric matrix with a single non-zero minor diagonal.
