We can't just multiply by the kronecker delta because it ends up like
``multiplying both sides by zero'' -- the kronecker delta will naturall arise but you
can't just multiply both sides by it.

If you're ever asked to write an equation of the form:
\[
\mathbb{x}^T\mathbb{A}\mathbb{x} = 1
\]
then you should represent $\mathbb{A}$ as a symmetric matrix.
