\item What advantage does a single virtual address space design offer over
traditional unix-style multiple virtual address spaces?

\iffalse % TODO

You don't need to have different TLBs

You don't need different page tables -- it saves space.

However, you can also access other processes addresses (doesn't offer
protection)

\begin{examquestion}{2004}{6}{2}

the ARM processor allows the second operand to be shifted by an arbitrary
amount. In order to improve the performance, a six-shage pipeline is
proposed with the following stages:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
instruction & decode and & shift & execute & memory & register \\
fetch & register fetch & operand 2 & & access & write back \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item What are control hazards and how could they be resolved in the above
pipeline?

\iffalse % TODO

John went through this in the summer work

\item What are data hazards and how could they be resolved in the above
pipeline?

% TODO

\item What are feed-forward paths and where could they be added to the above
pipeline to improve performance?

% TODO

\item Why might a branch instruction result in pipeline bubbles and how many
bubbles will appear in the above pipeline as a result of taking a branch
instruction?

following terms mean and why it is important to CPU cache design (hint: for
each principle of cache design, give an example use case when it is very
appropriate and when it is very inappropriate)
