The questions were done in separate pdf's (as they would be in a real exam). They're merged into one for 
submission on kudos. Unfortunately this has messed up the page counting.

At this point, the main area which I feel needs work is answering past questions since I'm finding 
a recurring theme of ``I'm confused as to what question is asking me to do'' rather than ``I don't know 
how to answer this question'' if that makes sense.
However, since MLRWD is fairly new and doesn't have many past questions  I'm not too sure how to address 
this.

The first question went well. I finished with enough time to review and refine. The main 
``I'm not sure exactly what they want'' was the diagram. I ended up drawing a Moore Machine.

I found the second question very awkward. There were quite a few parts on which I was confused 
as to what the question wanted. Looking back I understand them now (except the first part of 
(a)(i) which still looks bizarre).
