\section{Interaction Design Supervision 2}

\begin{itemize}

\item Don't mention features you want! Frame it like ``We would expect this
website to conform to this design pattern and we would expect that \_\_\_ and it
doesn't''.

\item Relate flaws to the criteria of Heuristic Evaluation.

\item Cognitive Walkthrough is very cost-efficient.

\item Heuristic Evaluation is more about visual errors

\item Cognitive Walkthrough is mainly oriented as usability problems

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dogfooding}

\begin{itemize}

\item You get rid of most of the problems very quickly

\item Employees may know the company too much and won't be too useful

\item Power imbalance -- for dogfooding you have to have a certain culture in
the website

\item Often, employees are not representative of the userbase

\item You can get feedback without releasing information to the public

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{User Research Methods}

In exploratory types of user research, you start with a hypothesis and then
test using qualitative and quantitative. You then repeat these until you get
a solid conclusion.

In embedded research you use both types of research.
