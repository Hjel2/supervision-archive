\section*{Rule Induction:}

Rule induction is like mathematical induction -- except rather than inducting over the 
natural numbers, you induct over the strings in S.

There are two uses of rule induction:

\begin{itemize}

\item Showing that all strings in an inductively defined set satisfy a property

\item Showing that a set $S$ is a superset of an inductively defined set $I$

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Showing a property is satisfied:}

Lets say that we wish to prove all strings in an inductively defined set $I$ 
satisfy a property $P$.

To do this we show that every axiom of $I$ satisfies the property $P$.

We then show that if all strings in the hypothesis satisfy $P$ then all strings which 
can be derived by any rule of $I$ also satisfy $P$.

IE if $\frac{u}{aub}$ is a rule then we would show that $P(u) \Longrightarrow P(aub)$

We must do this for every rule. 

This proves that a property is satisfied for every string $I$ in an inductively defined set 
using Rule Induction.

\subsection*{Showing $I \subseteq S$:}

To show that a set $S$ is a superset of an inductively defined set $I$, we show that the 
axioms of $I$ are in $S$ and all conclusions that can be drawn from those axioms are also in 
$S$.

IE if $I$ has axiom $\frac{\hspace{0.5cm}}{a}$ and rule $\frac{u}{aub}$, showing that 
$a \in S$ and $\forall u \in I. u \in S \Longrightarrow aub \in S$ would show that $I \subseteq S$.
