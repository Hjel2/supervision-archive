make clear the logical steps between lines of maths
add implication symbols and include existential and forall symbols
natural numbers include 0
state all assumptions -- ie sum of a and b is defined when a =/= 0 and b =/= 0
learn uniqueness of prime number decomposition. If you don't then ask the lecturer if you can use it in the questions

keep track of variable scope
so know when you do need new vairables and when you don't need new variables

an extra challenge
some that you answer by counterexample
Don't answer them by counterexample. Prove them properly.
Describe infinitely many counterexamples
or see what assumptions you'd need to add to make the statement true
or find minimal counterexamples (expose the falseness of the statement in the simplest way)
