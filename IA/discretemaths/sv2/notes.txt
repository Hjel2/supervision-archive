You can "divide" by numbers only if you are modulo a prime number.
This is essentilaly the same as multiplying by an inverse of the number you're dividing by.
ie 5k = 5m (mod 7) <=> 3x5k =3x5m (mod 7) <=> k = m (mod 7)
It otherwise only works if you've got a multiplicative inverse

Which happens iff you have numbers which are comprime

ab  = 1modm
ab = km + 1 -> ab and m are coprime

If m and k are coprime then in general; 
a = b(mod m)
a = d(mod k)
means you can find the value of 
a(mod km)
"chinese remainder theorem"

cleaner solutions to remainder functions and to associativity
work to make it in a nicer km + c solution
do remainder and quotient functions. You take the thing inside the remainder and repeatedly apply the quo(m, k) + rem(m, k) = m

\equiv (mod m) is one operator.
For supervisions you can write it as \equiv_m

prove that repunits are 3 (mod 4) and that hence it's impossible to have a square number that is 3 (mod 4)

Write things out to be explicit so it's clear where things came from. IE "from inspection of the multiplication table modulo 10"

k^2 = 1 (mod p) => k = +-1 (mod p)

equivalence classes are transitive, symmetric and reflexive.
