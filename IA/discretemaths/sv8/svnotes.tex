\section*{And($M_1, M_2$)}

Remember the and construction for the \textit{And} of two DFA's $M_1$, $M_2$.

The formula is in the question sheet:

Given two DFA's:
\[
\begin{split}
M_1 &= (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, s_1, F_1) \\
M_2 &= (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, s_2, F_2) \\
\end{split}
\]

The DFA defined as:
\[
M = (Q_1\times Q_2, \Sigma, \delta, (s_1, s_2), F_1\times F_2)
\]
\[
\delta((q_1, q_2), a) = (\delta_1(q_1, a), \delta_2(q_2, a))
\]

Is the DFA which is in an accepting state when \textit{BOTH} $M_1$, $M_2$ are in accepting states.

\section*{Pumping Lemma}

Note that $L$ is a regular language implies that $L$ enjoys the Pumping Lemma property. 

A language $L$ enjoys the Pumping Lemma property does not imply that it is regular:

\vspace{0.5cm}

Regular Language $\Longrightarrow$ Pumping Lemma

Pumping Lemma $\not\Longrightarrow$ Regular

The Pumping Lemma states that for all regular languages, if they accept a string $s$ 
of length $\geq \ell$ for some $\ell$ then there exists some $u_1 v u_2 = s$ where $|v| \geq 1$ ($v \neq \varepsilon$) 
and $|u_1v| \leq \ell$ such that $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}. u_1 v^n u_2 \in L$. 

To prove a language is not regular, you must find some $w_\ell$ for arbitrary $\ell$ 
which cannot be pumped. 

So for $L = a^nb^n$, you find $w_\ell = a^\ell b^\ell$ and say that ``since the first $\ell$ letters 
are $a$, $v$ must be some sequence of $a$'s of length $s$, $u_1$ is length $r$ and $u_2$ is $a^{\ell - r - s}b^\ell$. 
Then consider $v^2$ then the string is now $a^{\ell + r}b^\ell$. $r \neq 0$ so $\ell + r \neq \ell$. 
So the string is not of the form $a^nb^n$. However it is still in the language $L$. So $L$ cannot 
be pumped and hence $L$ is not regular.
