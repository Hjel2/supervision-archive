\item Properties of links

\begin{itemize}

\item Bandwidth

\item Link Latency

\item Packet Delay

\item \[
\text{packet delay} = \frac{\text{packet size}}{\text{Link bandwidth}} +
\text{Link Latency}
\]

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Does CDMA waste bandwidth?}

\item How many frequencies can you transmit on one wire?

FDM would be worth it for packet switching if and only if the number of
frequencies you can transmit at the same time is greater than the number of
bits in a packet.

\item How do VPNs work?

Why do you need two transport and network layers?

\item What's the difference between a router and a switch?

Switches forward packets that are directly connected to it. They can only
forward it to the devices that are connected to it -- this only uses the
data link layer using the MAC address.

Routers send packets between networks using the IP address on the network
layer.

\item Shannon Information Formula

What is the Noise Power

What is the Signal Power

What is Information Capacity

\item Line Coding / Baud Rates

\item Asynchronous versus Synchronous

Slide 16 topic 3
